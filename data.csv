tl7m-hobPyU,SECRET CHILD,A single mother meets a wealthy man who takes an interest in her son.,"
Gordon is a young boy growing up in 1950s Dublin. Even for the time, he has an unusual childhood: he has grown up in a Regina Coeli hostel for unmarried mothers, run by nuns and sheltered from the larger world. Regina Coeli was both a haven and a prison in many ways, but Gordon has started to wander beyond its walls, where he gets in fights with the other kids. But he's still surrounded by lots of love, cared for by his mother Cathleen, who works hard to give Gordon the best childhood possible.

His small world begins to shift when he and his mother meet up with a man named Bill for dinner. Bill is obviously wealthy, and quite interested in Gordon, who approaches this new acquaintance with great enthusiasm. But even with this first encounter, the small, cloistered world of mother and son begins to shift, even as it promises broader horizons.

nfK79Xblpus,NULLARBOR,A man with road rage confronts an elderly driver. Then all hell breaks loose.,"
One man drives across the vast and barren landscape of Australia's Nullarbor Plain, which has the longest stretch of straight road in the world.

As the brash young upstart traverses the epic vista, he passes a slower, more laidback motorist and almost gets into an accident. Seeking payback, he goes after the old codger.

But the other motorist proves himself surprisingly intrepid despite his clunky old car and his slow pace. As the younger man tries to outpace him and encounters one obstacle after another, the older man slogs along steadily, adding a new, boisterous twist in this update of the classic ""tortoise and hare"" tale.

Becca is out for a run one morning, but as she makes her way down one of the backstreets of her neighborhood, she sees a man and a woman having a fight. Then she sees something truly unsettling: the man shoves her hard enough to knock her out cold. Becca and the man make eye contact as he realizes what he's done, but before he can say or do anything to her, she runs away, scared for her own safety.

Time passes and she's lulled back into a sense of safety, trying to put the memory behind her. Until one evening, when she meets the man out one night at a bar -- and he insists on walking along the way with her at the end of the night.

CmQneYZvTlM,TALES FROM THE MULTIVERSE,God tries to create 'Earth'. But he can't get a break from the kids.,"
Up in the heavens, God is a stressed-out software developer, making adjustments to the cosmos on his computer as he tests out a new program called Multiverse. He's also a busy single parent who can't seem to get a break from his rambunctious kids, an angel and devil who are always fighting and baby Jesus screaming in the background.

One particular day when the kids are acting up and melting down, he's too busy to pay attention to his computer, and the cosmos goes slightly awry -- leading to a creation of a very different world as we know it.

This fun, rollicking animated short -- made by the team at acclaimed Danish animation house Tumblehead -- is a unique ""alternate world"" take on the story of creation, imagining the ""great creator"" in a new way that's likely highly relatable in the age of pandemic parenting, though the was made before the global onset of Covid-19. With great wit and an almost acrobatic sense of invention, it hops, skips and wiggles around the cosmos, imagining the comedic mayhem that results when the loose ends of creation are left dangling.

Portrayed in a mix of 2D and 3D animation, the scale of the storytelling is vast, as the distracted half-made adjustments by God play out throughout the universe. Dinosaurs, people and other creatures evolve in unexpected ways, which play out over a wide-ranging tapestry of time and space. Adam -- the original man -- in particular has an eventful, consequential run-in with an alien, with amusing consequences.

Like many animated shorts, it takes advantage of the imaginative possibilities of the medium to cram the 7-minute runtime with gags, jokes and flourishes of whimsy, starting with the creation of a universe by a computer program called Multiverse, which vaguely resembles an old program of Windows. It's funny to imagine that the whole of the cosmos can be compressed into one app, but with the vagaries of technology, it also means that mistakes can propagate much faster and much more widely.
